Recommendations for Organisations
Preventive Measures
Inform users directly (e.g. disseminate information through monthly statements, leaflets, publications or websites) about the preventive measures that your organisation has implemented e.g. Your organisation

will not send emails with embedded hyperlinks to websites to its users; and

will not ask for users' personal information or account information such as user identity or passwords via email.

Keep websites certificates up to date so that users are assured the legitimacy of the websites.

Provide telephone number for users of the websites to verify and report for any suspicious email requests for information that claimed to be sent by the organisation, which shall be available for all time.

Consider to register domain names that are similar to the one that is currently used by the organisation e.g. in addition to the original domain name "www.abcbank.com.hk", domain names "www.abcbank.com", "www.abc.com", "www.abcbank.hk" can also be registered.

Develop a trademark for the domain name of the organisation and register it to minimise the risk of being misused or duplicated.

Strengthen the security controls of the websites, applications and email systems of the organisation e.g. using technological solutions such as SSL, two-factor authentication, digital certificates, firewalls, anti-virus solutions, enhancing fraud monitoring or reporting mechanisms and so on.

Strengthen the operational controls such as setting a lower limit on the maximum amount of transaction or fund transfer per day or pre-registration before authorised to perform certain types of online transactions via Internet.

Educate users about the best practices that they should follow and observe when using your Internet services.
