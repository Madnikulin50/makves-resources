# Реакция на DDOS-атаку

## ПОДГОТОВКА
PREPARATION
This is likely the most difficult yet most important phase because it lays the foundation. Without adequate preparation, failure is virtually certain. The midst of an attack is no time to be trying to figure out your response.

First, build the team and assign responsibilities. Response to advanced threats is often regarded as the responsibility of security operations teams, while DDoS defense typically falls to a network team, not the security team. Breaking down those silos is critical for communication during an attack. Establish upstream and downstream relationships and contact procedures — who is going to call whom, and why.

IDENTIFICATION

CLASSIFICATION
What kind of attack are you seeing? This tells you how you can expect it to proceed, and what kinds of countermeasures you need to employ.

TRACEBACK
Ascertain the origin of the attack — where is it coming from? Where and how is it affecting the network? This can help explain whether other network problems you are seeing are related to the attack.

REACTION
Having identified, classified and traced back the attack, you will be better prepared to implement the most appropriate mitigation tool. No one tool or technique is applicable in all circumstances. It pays to have a varied toolkit at hand, and to leverage automated response capabilities wherever possible.

POST-MORTEM
Analyze what happened. What can you learn? What can you do better? What is the one step everyone missed? How can you make the response faster, easier or less painful the next time? Anything concrete that comes of your findings, loop back to phase one and incorporate it into your preparation process.

## ОБНАРУЖЕНИЕ
Without sufficient network visibility, enterprises lack the information needed to understand whether poor service or application performance is a result of DDoS attack traffic, or a network misconfiguration. On-premise solutions provide the critical traffic visibility needed to quickly diagnose the issue, saving IT and network teams valuable time while improving performance.
